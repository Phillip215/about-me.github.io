        <p>I pretty much love all music other than country. My father and mother would play music throughout the day of

      <h2>Why Software Engineering</h2>
      <p>My path to coding in general was paved with me working jobs at maximum effort and feeling like it was leading
        to minimal gain overall. When the pandemic happened my job was considered essential so I thought I would be
        secure in my position. Unfortunately the place I had worked was losing business do to the pandemic and I was one
        of the people they let go. For about two months I stayed inside waiting for the nightmare to be over so I could
        begin my job search. That's when it hit me that I would have to start from square one at a business for the
        third time in my life. That is when I decided to gain skills in Software Engineering not only for the new career path but also to put my in position for goals I have outside of the workplace.</p>
